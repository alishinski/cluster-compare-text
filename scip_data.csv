And so people can use it for any kind of landform and not to search for a specific explanation for each landform.,"My revised explanation fits the evidence I collected in the unit by giving specific examples of how water shapes the land (erosion, deposition, frost wedging).","MSU. Because they gave this test to our class, and have been studying the class a lot lately.","I would show them the stream table activity, and look at the picture of the Grand Canyon where the water is flowing in the same shape as the canyon."301176,6,4,6,To show people that I know how water shaped our world. I might use my explanation for teaching little kids.,Data detail and a model with a key.,I think it should focus because they can't always be right.,It shows how are world is shaped by water.,Little kids so they can learn ahead of time.,If it was little we wouldn't have oceans or rivers or canyons or valleys.301182,6,4,6,The purpose of my explanation is because some people may not know how a river canyons are formed.,"What makes a good explanation is having details to help the reader picture in in their minds, having a good grip on what your explaining, making sure you have the whole main idea about the topic.",I think my explanation should address all the different ways that water shapes landforms. Because different landforms were formed almost the same way as my model.,My explanation fits the evidence in this unit because in this unit we learned about what formed the Grand Canyon.,For people who want to know how water shapes landforms. Because thats what my model is showing.,"Yes water is small, but if you've been on a beach, water moves and breaks sand. Sand is broken rocks so why can't water break rocks."301125,6,4,6,I might use the explanation when explaining how a river canyon is formed or how and river is formed.,A good explanation usually explains what's going on and how it's happening. It usually should give the reader a pretty good image of exactly what happens in their heads.,It could possibly represent everything. Because it's mainly the same process except sometimes it could be breaking down and through different kinds of Earth materials.,My explanation fits the evidence I've collected in this unit because I now understand a bit more about the process of erosion and weathering and such.,My explanation is for anyone who wants to know how and why a water shapes landforms. Because it explains that process so that they would understand at least a little bit after reading it.,"I would explain that maybe one small drop of water couldn't, but if you had a whole lot of forceful water it could definitely shape it after time."301341,6,4,6,The purpose of my explanation is to give it to MSU. I might use my explanation for science.,You need to be descriptive and stay on track.,I think it should address all the different ways that water shapes landforms. Because water weathers earth materials similarly everywhere.,My revised explanation fits the evidence I collected very well. We learned that water erodes earth materials slowly and I put that in my explanation.,I think it is for MSU. Because they will study it.,If you have a lot of water it is strong. Flowing water is really strong and can chip rocks a little at a time. Over time it will chip more and more and make shapes.301136,6,4,6,To tell how rivers are formed.,Like I've said before it tells how rivers are formed.,All things because the Grand Canyon isn't the only thing that water formed.,"It shows how water shapes our world through erosion, deposition, and weathering.",MSU to study what I've learned.,I would tell them that there is so much water on the Earth and is really powerful and maybe show them a stream table for proof.301225,6,4,6,How a river canyons are formed.,"Answer and why I think this, supporting answer will make a good explanation.",I think mine is for all of the because all land forms have water marks so I think water because it can cut through rock.,Because we looked at pictures of land forms and they all have water marks on the edge.,A teacher or a land forms scientist because they can understand how kids think how  land forms are formed.,Well all land forms have marks of water and water can cut through rock.301195,6,4,6,To show oxygen.,"A key, picture, and words.",No it should show all because the grand canyon is not the only thing that was eroded.,Show how water movement occurs and what it can do.,A scientist because they study things like this,The stronger or faster water the faster it snaps things.301181,6,4,6,To teach people who don't know about this subject.,"Evidence, mechanics, and audience.",All different ways. Because science is general.,"When we used the stream table, the sand traveled with the water.","People who don't understand. No one who does will read this, besides MSU/to understand.","If water is small, then why is our Earth mostly water? Water is powerful. You need is a to figure that out."301123,6,4,6,I might use this explanation for my teacher to see how much I know about canyons or someone who isn't sure about how the canyons were formed.,"Most of the time, you have to add details according to the picture and a key showing what you are actually talking about and try not to get off topic.","Yes and no. It usually depends. If you say that the canyons were formed by elves, no. But you can explain to that person by weathering and erosion that is the cause or nature.",My revised explanation fits the evidence I collected because I thought about the erosion or weathering through out the unit.,People who don't know how it was formed. So I can explain through their knowledge and explain that nature sometimes carves rocks and other things from water or wind. ,"I can explain to them that if water was really fast, it could carve out slowly the base of it if it can break it apart piece by piece."301134,6,4,6,Explaining how rivers make land form to the teachers.,Have a idea and model and a explanation.,Because water form more than one thing. Because the water explains how some landforms are formed.,That water forms some land form.,People because some people don't know.,Water has so much strength to move continents so it takes a long time to cover.301191,6,4,6,You could use it to explain how water shapes our world.,Details and organization. That can make a good explanation.,Specific. It helps the models work for people that need it. Everyone has their own model.,It fits because the Grand Canyon is made the same way.,People who study rocks. They can know what goes on with canyons. IT is there first and it is stronger than they think.,It is there first and it is stronger than they think.301168,6,4,6,I would use my explanation to help others who don't know that much about water. Also I could learn more about water by going back to my explanation and adding more to it.,I good explanation needs to have very descriptive writing. Also it needs to have great details so the reader can picture your writing.,It should address all different ways water shapes landforms. This is because there are different ways that water can shape landforms but in the Grand Canyon there is only one.,It does because we talked about the spread of the water and how it breaks apart rocks.,I think it is for other students. This is because it helps other students learn about how water shapes our world or we could compare what we think.,Water might be small but if it keeps pushing on the same rock all day and night the rock is eventually break off.301170,6,4,6,The purpose of my explanation is so you can understand what I drew I might use it for explaining how river canyons act. Were formed.,,It should address all because it is general and helps with all.,I donï¿_Ûªt know how,Me you the teacher because it helps me learn and your getting it.,I could take a peace of chalk and run water over it to show the how the chalk breaks down.301139,6,4,6,To explain the canyon picture.,Explaining using good words.,No one topic. Because they you can focus on what happened to that land form.,The same.,Those who don't understand. To understand.,Stick them in raging rapids to show them it can hurt. So I'm pretty sure it can shape land.301229,6,4,6,To show people what I think about how canyons are formed.,Detail and pictures.,Grand Canyon because it can be formed by wind to.,Great I learned in class.,My teacher so she can see my work.,The Grand Canyon river.301202,6,4,6,The purpose is to show erosion. I might use it for telling people how canyons are formed.,A good explanation has to be detailed and factual. An explanation also has to be easy to understand while still proving the point.,"It should address all ways because it needs to be in depth. IT should because an explanation needs to be in depth, and showing all possible ways something can happen.","My revised explanation fits because all he talked about in this unit is how water eroded our land and why, we also talked about how water could have formed canyon rivers.","This explanation is for every body. It is for every body because everybody deserves to learn everything about the world, and how it form.","I might convince that person with my explanation, showing how if there is a lot of water in an area, it can shape landforms because of the massive amount of H20."
